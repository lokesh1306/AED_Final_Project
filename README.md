# Problem Statement:
According to a UN report, as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021 – 46 million people more from a year earlier and 150 million more from 2019.
Around 2.3 billion people in the world (29.3%) were moderately or severely food insecure in 2021 – 350 million more compared to before the outbreak of the COVID‑19 pandemic. Nearly 924 million people (11.7% of the global population) faced food insecurity at severe levels, an increase of 207 million in two years.
More than 48 million people are facing emergency levels of hunger, with the threat of acute malnutrition, starvation, and death, according to the World Food Programme (WFP).
Even though there is enough food in the world to feed everyone, many people fall under the poverty line, as a result of which they are unable to afford to buy food.

The US alone throws away 103 million tons (206 billion pounds), the equivalent of over 450,000 Statue of Liberties and more than any other country in the world, estimated to be 30-40 percent of the entire US food supply.

Similarly, the world wastes about 1.4 billion tons of food every year. All this wasted food would have been enough to provide nearly 130 billion.

The extra food from hotels, restaurants, stores, homes ends up in the trash without being used productively.

# Our Vision:
Our vision is to see a world where food is no longer wasted and instead used productively, which would in turn reduce or even eliminate hunger.

#Our Objective:
The main objective of our food cloud is to connect the donors who have excess food, such as individuals, restaurants and organizations with the requestors, such as individuals and organization who need food with the assistance of food warehouses, pantries and Non-Government Organizations.

# Our Approach: 
The donor, such as an individual, organization or a restaurant, who has excess food, will signup through our application and enter the amount of food they wish to donate. The request will be forwarded to the nearest warehouse where the warehouse admin will request for a volunteer from a participating NGO.

Once the NGO assigns a volunteer to a warehouse, the warehouse admin can assign a pickup task so that the volunteer can pickup the food from the donor and drop it off at the nearest pantry.

Similarly, a food requestor registers with our application and enters the amount of food they require. The request will be then forwarded to the nearest pantry. If the amount of food requested is within the stock available with the pantry, the manager will assign a volunteer to deliver the food to the requestor. 

Finally, the volunteer in question would pickup the food from the pantry and deliver it to the recipient.
